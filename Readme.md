# Docker-inside-Docker

## Story Line:

Recently I was facing some issue with my windows , i couldn't build my npm build for some reason but i have installed Docker-desktop in my pc . So i thought it would be best to put docker  so i try to find any official repository but i couldn't find my favorite ubuntu  so i create a bash script to run docker  inside of docker and surpricingly that does work .

So this is **A Docker Environment Inside of Docker Ubuntu Instance.**
